P-D defense is a MATLAB software repository.
For installation simply add the 'functions' folder to your Matlab path.
To design the detecor, use the tools provided in the 'scripts' folder.

For use of the detectors described in the paper, include the 'dat'
folder in your Matlab path and call the function 'pincerDetector'.
